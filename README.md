###Why build this?
It was fun  
It was also good to test my JS skills. In this side project I wanted to follow OO principles write code following the MVP pattern. It was fun just getting more practice with the language and while the end result isnt that serious the code behind it is.

###Writing this
I actually started writing this and then saw myself going down a bad path. I wanted to start fresh and in order to not make similar mistakes I thought using the MVC pattern would make writing this game go smoother(it did). Writing this a second time was much faster and cleaner. There are still some refactorings that could be made to DRY out some behaviors but I am very pleased with the quality of this code.
